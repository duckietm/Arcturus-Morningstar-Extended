/**
 * Interface for wired effects in the new context-driven architecture.
 * <p>
 * Effects are the actions performed when a trigger fires and all conditions pass.
 * They receive a {@link WiredContext} containing all relevant data and should use
 * {@link WiredContext#services()} for all side effects.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Best Practices:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Use {@code ctx.services()} for all room mutations (teleport, toggle, etc.)</li>
 *   <li>Use {@code ctx.targets()} to get users/items to affect</li>
 *   <li>Check {@code ctx.actor()} before operations requiring a user</li>
 *   <li>Call {@code ctx.state().step()} before expensive operations (automatic in engine)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Simulation Mode:</h3>
 * <p>
 * When WiredExtraRequireFullExecution is present, movement effects are first run in
 * simulation mode via {@link #simulate(WiredContext, WiredSimulation)}. Movement effects
 * should record their intended position changes to the simulation. If all effects pass
 * simulation, they are then executed for real.
 * </p>
