/**
 * Where a variable change came from, so the "variable changed" trigger can listen to some sources
 * and ignore others. Three origins exist today: a wired box in this room, the web API, and the
 * creator tools (inspection, management, the inline editors). The origin travels with the thread
 * that performs the write: the few entry points that are not the wired engine label themselves,
 * and everything else is a wired write.
 *
 * <p>A trigger stores the origins it listens to as a bit mask over these codes; {@link #MASK_ALL}
 * (and, for boxes saved before the mask existed, 0) means every origin.
